## Samurai

Whether fighting for a lord or as an exile, honor is at the Samurai's core. Upholding it, together with tradition, he employs age old techniques in battle. As a life-long student and master of both combat and social encounters, he is a fierce opponent, but also a noble ally.

#### Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.

#### Fighting Stance

Starting at 3rd level, you learn a fighting stance, enhancing your combat abilities. When you take the Attack action, or as a bonus action on your turn, you adjust your posture and the way you hold your weapons, allowing you to anticipate your foe or strike true.

_**Earth.**_ A defensive stance used to deflect blows. Holding your weapon low, you wait for your opponent to strike and leave an opening. Until the start of your next turn, your AC increases by 2. As a reaction, you can increase this bonus to 4. You may do this after the roll, but before your DM tells you whether the attack hits or misses.

_**Fire.**_ This offensive posture raises the weapon high above the head, leaving the body exposed, but readying a powerful strike. You gain advantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of your turn.

_**Water.**_ Traditionally the most basic, this middle-level stance is a balance between offense and defense and focuses on using your opponents power against itself. Until the start of your next turn, when a melee weapon attack misses you, you can use your reaction to make an attack against the creature that missed the attack, using its own attack modifier.

_**Wind.**_ By maneuvering your weapon sideways, you can move more quickly and parry blows more effectively. Your movement speed increases by 15 feet until the end of your turn. Additionally, your swiftness grants you a +4 bonus to your AC against opportunity attacks.

Whenever you adopt a stance on your turn, you gain 5 temporary hit points. This increases to 10 and 15 temporary hit points at 10th and at 15th level.

You can choose another one of these stances to learn at 7th, 10th and 15th level. You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Elegant Courtier

Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

#### Tireless Spirit

Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Stance remaining, you regain one use.

#### Stance Improvements

Starting at 15th level, you learn how to combine stances, break out of them or simply use them more effectively.

_**Earth.**_ While in Earth Stance and subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your reaction to angle your weapon so you take no damage on a success and only half damage on a failed saving throw.

_**Fire.**_ While in Fire stance, you can forgo the advantage on one of the attacks and make an extra weapon attack against that target instead, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.

_**Water.**_ When you make an attack with the creature's own attack modifier while in Water stance, you can make an additional attack with a melee weapon yourself as part of that reaction against that creature.

_**Wind.**_ Whenever a creature makes an opportunity attack against you when you are in Wind stance, they provoke opportunity attacks from your allies within 5 feet of them.

Additionally, while in a stance, you can suddenly change your posture again to surprise your foe. On your turn, you can expend another use of Fighting Stance to swap stances, no action required. When it's another creature's turn, this also uses your reaction. When you do so, you gain the temporary hit points as normal.

#### Strength before Death

Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
